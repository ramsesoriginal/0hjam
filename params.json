It took me more then 0h to make the game, (I started at 2am, and finished at 2:20am ca.) so I guess I failed.\r\n\r\nBut it is my first game jam game, and I finished it, so I consider it a personal success!\r\n\r\nThe reasons why it took so long:\r\n\r\n   * My Unity License Expirer, had to get that to work\r\n   * Unity Crashed thrice\r\n   * Github for WIndows froze multiple times\r\n   * When creating the project, I accidentally imported a ton of packages, so creating hte project took over 20min\r\n   * I'm ill, so I spent a while not at the computer (I'll spare oyu the details)\r\n   \r\nSo yeah, there are reasons why it didn't work out. And yet those are all just excuses: I failed the jam.\r\n\r\nWhat did I learn from the jam:\r\n\r\n   * I have to be healthy when making jams, making them ill sucks\r\n   * PREPARATION IS EVERYTHING. If I'd have opened unity, created the repository and the empty unity project, I'd easilly have finished in time.\r\n   * Solid green backgrounds are hard on the eyes ;-)","google":"UA-56097249-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
