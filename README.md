0h jam / 0h Game / Falling Balls
======

I participated in the 0h jam (http://0hgame.eu/). It took me more then 0h to make the game, (I started at 2am, and finished at 2:20am ca.) so I guess I failed.

But it is my first game jam game, and I finished it, so I consider it a personal success!

The reasons why it took so long:

   * My Unity License Expirer, had to get that to work
   * Unity Crashed thrice
   * Github for WIndows froze multiple times
   * When creating the project, I accidentally imported a ton of packages, so creating hte project took over 20min
   * I'm ill, so I spent a while not at the computer (I'll spare oyu the details)
   
So yeah, there are reasons why it didn't work out. And yet those are all just excuses: I failed the jam.

What did I learn from the jam:

   * I have to be healthy when making jams, making them ill sucks
   * PREPARATION IS EVERYTHING. If I'd have opened unity, created the repository and the empty unity project, I'd easilly have finished in time.
   * Solid green backgrounds are hard on the eyes ;-)
